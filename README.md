# Hi 👋, I'm Moh Rizqi Hilman Riyadi!

I am a Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer with 2+ years of experience in manual and automated testing of web applications, APIs, and enterprise systems. I have a strong background in requirement analysis, test planning, execution, and defect tracking, ensuring high-quality and reliable software delivery. ✨

## What I Do

🛠 Manual Testing: Create and execute detailed test cases and test scenarios to validate business and technical requirements.  
🤖 Automated Testing: Develop and maintain UI automation using `Playwright` and `Katalon Studio`.  
🔍 Defect Tracking: Identify, report, and track bugs using `Mantis`, working closely with developers for timely fixes.  
🌐 API Testing: Perform API testing using `Postman` to ensure reliable system integration.  
📊 Performance Testing: Conduct load and performance testing using `JMeter` and `K6`.  
🛡 Security Testing: Perform basic security testing using `Acunetix` and `OWASP ZAP`.  
🧩 Integration & UAT: Execute integration testing and support `User Acceptance Testing (UAT)`.  
📑 Documentation: Create test plans, test cases, SOPs, user manuals, and QA reports.
